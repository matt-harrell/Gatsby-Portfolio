This app shows the users top songs and the Spotify audio profile for each song.This app uses 5 categories to show the audio profile for each song.

*Unfortunately Spotifyâ€™s API policy does not allow automatic user onboarding for portfolio projects/hobby projects. This means I have to manually add users to the app in order for them to be authenticated through Spotify. If you wish to preview the app please fill out my contact form and I will add you as a user as soon as possible.*
