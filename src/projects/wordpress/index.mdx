This is a website I created for a nonprofit called Heartoscope, a nonprofit in Greenville, NC, using the Divi, a custom WordPress theme builder. When I was creating this website, I collaborated with a designer and content strategist to translate their designs and strategy into a working website. I also used Google Lighthouse to address several audits to make the website accessible and mobile optimized while incorporating SEO strategies. In order to help the client with managing their website, I also created several YouTube videos to help train the client on how to use Divi."
